## If you found an issue

1. If the bug could be caused by your own `~/.vimrc`, make a backup of it and
   retry with a bare-minimum configuration.
2. Search for open and closed issues on the GitHub repository.
3. Open an issue, explaining the problem, and including all available and
   relevant details.
4. Describe how to replicate the issue. Include some sample text and the
   bare-minimum `~/.vimrc` required to replicate the issue.

## If you fixed an issue

1. Use the feature branches and the `devel` branch until the code is ready for
   release. This keeps the `master` branch stable for users.
2. Ideally use your commit to close the issue, using the steps described
   [here](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/#closing-an-issue-in-a-different-repository).
3. Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
